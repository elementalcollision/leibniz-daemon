"""Serialize the Calculemus ledger to the codexcalculemus.com source ledger.

Bridges the daemon's in-memory `Calculemus` (R6) to the Astro site: it reads the
operator-published laws and the held-back Codex, and emits the JSON ledger the
site's `sync-ledger.mjs` consumes. Read-only over the ledger — it writes no
`kernel_verified` and no `promulgated`, and mints no edge; it only reports what
`Calculemus` already decided (promotion is gated there; publication is the
operator's act). `kernel_verified`/`qed` are read straight from the Demonstratio.

    A cycle records what the daemon *did* — seeds surveyed, candidates quarantined,
    and (when it happens) a law promulgated. It is descriptive, not a certificate:
    it carries **no** `kernel_verified`, mints **no** edge, and promulgates nothing.
    Any kernel/Z3 evidence a cycle references lives under `findings`/`artifacts` as
    *reported* results, tagged by the checker that produced them — never as a
    promulgated Q.E.D. (`laws` only lists ids of laws the gated pipeline already
    promulgated; publication remains the operator's separate, guarded act.)

    **Sources MUST be cited.** Any cycle that audits, verifies, refutes, or builds on
    external work carries a `references` list — APA-formatted citations rendered as a
    reference list at the foot of the published page. Each reference is a dict
    ``{"citation": "<full APA reference>", "url": "<optional link>"}``. This is a hard
    scholarly-integrity requirement, enforced by ``requires_references``; a cite-worthy
    cycle with no references is a defect, not a stylistic choice.

    **Link back to the code.** When a cycle pulls code from a repository — the source we
    audited, or our own repo where the verification artifacts live — that repository is
    recorded in `repositories`, each entry a dict
    ``{"name", "url", "role", "note"}`` (``role`` ∈ audited / produced / contributed /
    source), ideally pinned to the exact commit or PR. Papers go in `references` (APA);
    repositories go here. Together they are the tractable, auditable trail of existence.
